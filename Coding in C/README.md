Prog 1_1.c: Prompts user to input their name, and the program prints a greeting to them using their name.

Prog1_2.c: Implements the MakeStack from the header prog1_2.h file. Utilizes the push, pop, and grow functions of a stack.

Prog1_3.c: The driver program that allows the user to input a single command line argument, then uses the MakeStack function from prog1_2.c to push and pop off the stack.
