Goal: To familiarize ourselves with the Lua environment while using C/C++

Prog3_1: Coded in C++, the first part takes in a single command line argument which is a lua file. It then executes the lua file in the lua environment I created in C++.

Prog3_2: Coded in Lua, the second part implements the Infix to Postfix function. The function takes a single string argument, tokenizes it by space, and then returns the postfix string. I implement this by using if/then statements that check the priority of the mathematical operations then implements the algorithm.

Prog3_3: COded in C++, the last part is an extension of prog3_1.cpp. I also create a lua environment with C++ then takes in a lua file. It then executes the Infix to Postfix function, then prints the postfix string.
